# Cotton_DIsease_Prediction
Deep learning project to predict whether the cotton plant or leaf is a diseased cotton plant or diseased cotton leaf.
Here we are using Inception-v3 a CNN to classify the images.

* Inception-V3

Inception-v3 is a convolutional neural network that is 48 layers deep. You can load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database [1]. The pretrained network can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals. As a result, the network has learned rich feature representations for a wide range of images. 

Inception v3 is a widely-used image recognition model that has been shown to attain greater than 78.1% accuracy on the ImageNet dataset. The model is the culmination of many ideas developed by multiple researchers over the years.

* The complete code for model building is available in both " .ipynb" and " .py" format.
As the size of the model is huge, I could not able to upload here. To deploy it just build the model using the "cotton_disease" files.
* After building the model, deployed it using streamlit.

* Code for deployment is available in "cotton_api.py"
